We wanted to run a bunch of experiments for governance and different token models as part of future projects in the Ocean Protocol Ambassador program to explore and experience how beneficial they are on a small scale with a group of people that want to solve a task together.\nWould this overlap with your intentions?\n2. For DataUnion - a decentralised, crowdsourcing platform for machine learning ready data - we want to let the contributors get involved in turning the knobs of the system in terms of rewards as well as to determine what will be developed next but we have no real experience which kind of governance model would be most beneficial. To get more info on that we want to create a simulation based on TokenSpice.\nWould this overlap with your intentions?\n\nSorry for directly starting with some questions and maybe you are not at that point yet to answer them, I just found your project and thought I wanted to look for synergies as the space is very wide and difficult to manoeuvre."

    "Here's a draft description of the standard:\n\nScope and Usage\nA vote is a formal indication of a choice between two or more candidates or courses of action. A digital voting service is an internet service that allows users to create, configure, and run a vote, usually on a hosted platform. A voting API is a way of exposing a digital voting service to other web applications.\n\nThe voting standard described here is designed to (1) help developers build applications and governance systems on top of a standard voting API, without having to commit to or integrate with a specific software service and (2) help voting services integrate with new users and new platforms via Metagov’s existing libraries. \n\nThis standard comes with: \nmappings from a number of existing voting services into the standard API,\n[TBD] a client-side Python library (pip install metagov, import ",
    {
     "type": "link",
     "text": "metagov.voting"
    },
    ") that implements and wraps the standard API so that you can create and query votes directly in Python, and \n[TBD] a hosted version of the standard API at ",
    {
     "type": "link",
     "text": "metagov.org"
    },
    ".\n\nAt the bottom of this document, there is also a checklist to help voting services conform to the standard and to write their own mappings, as well as some examples of the kinds of applications that the voting standard enables."

I’m a huge SDG nerd 🤓 Very interesting how the paper describes the United Nations as a decentralized organization (One UN Commons) with two potential scenarios / models:\n\n1) project manager-led\n2) collaborator-led\n\nSeems both are necessary to “accurately account for cross-UN (cross-DAO) collaboration efforts while streamlining administration through aligned incentives and decentralized roles of UN personnel.”\n\nVisibility facilitates coordination by collaborators 🌐 Otherwise, it doesn’t feel as fairly incentivized!\n\nI’d love to understand why each and every hour is worth 1 UNicoin, what constitutes a valid recognition badge, and how time is non-monetary 💸\n\n“The creation and distribution policy of UNicoins seeks to be data driven, utilizing user data and meta-data of UNicoins issuance, institutional distribution, transfer, validation, and storage for policy optimization.”\n\n🦄🦄🦄\n\nMetrics:\n\n• Cross-UN collaboration tasks categorized by the SDGs (1-17)\n• Affiliated UN Entity or Entities of personnel requesting UNicoins enabled task(s)\n• Expected deliverables within a task\n• Quality assessment and validation of submitted tasks\n• Validation of number of hours submitted\n• Metadata showing exchanges of UNicoins and their circulation across the UN system\n\nUnanswered Questions:\n\n• How should UNicoins be created and by whom?\n• How can UNicoins be used as a transformative enabler to shift to the Next UN and not to reinforce malpractices in the current UN system? What mechanisms need to be in place to do so?\n• How can the concept and spirit of UNicoins as a way to enable peer-to-peer collaboration, exchange and learning be upheld and the possibilities for UNicoins to be abused or misused minimized?\n• How to ensure that UNicoins do not add to any precarious working conditions of staff?\n• How to ensure that UNicoins incentivizes increased collaboration between teams and agencies? Rather than having a stifling effect (e.g. team leaders or agencies start requiring / demanding UNicoins for collaboration with others)"

    "Great insights and hit directly on the issues we are exploring as we move into prototype stage. To address some of your questions: \n- The fixed exchange rate against an hour of time is based on the Japanese fureai kippu, meaning caring community. As time is inherently equal to all of us it is non-inflationary and thus maintains value. In the fureai kippu (FP) model voluntary service to assist elderly is recognized by FP tokens that are denominated in one hour increments. As we",

    },
    "will become old those who give service in youth can redeem them upon needing them later. This, one could argue it is not pure volunteering but a redemption specific form of time banking. \n- In our prototype we will airdrop UNicoins to users based on a self reported number of hours that have already provided to UN system in a limited period of retroactively (I.e 6 month prior). As we are a closed system this can be validated. Going forward we are looking at a few models such as having UN entities buy them at cost recovery rates, mint based on our prototype assessment of hours in circulation to maintain optimal monetary policy, burn for inactivity, and other models. We will test various theories of change in prototype period. \n- To foster transformative best practice is part based on the metrics / data strategy to ensure optimal quality. Initiatives will need to budget time and link to deliverables and SDG outcomes. Redemption post deliverable is assessed for quality with community input to rate impact. \n- To mitigate abuse is two fold the approval process of creating an initiative is based on a hierarchical meritocracy that requires users with high number of validated hours to approve projects. Budgets are capitalized from users accumulated UNicoins.\n- To avoid precarious working conditions the UNicoin activities should be voluntary. Though exploring policy that would allow all staff to volunteer up to 5% of their work time, which offers them career exposure. \n- To ensure collaboration every initiative has to have users from other UN entities (limiting collusion). Exploring minimum of three and various levels from each, which is similar to interagency working groups. \n\nWould really enjoy discussing in further details in Governaughts working groups for community input on how to optimize further as the prototypes start materializing"

   "text": "Thank you for exploring this idea with me. My own thoughts are not very mature so I thought this might be a good place to discuss this idea. \n\nWell, when I boil it down the main network IP is licensed under an open source agreement. That means it can’t be the equity in the economic system. The trademark may also be representative of the value of the network but that doesn’t explain enough the perceived value. As a result, a regulator can only determine if the token is a security or commodity based in the degree of decentralization in rendering the service and decision making. This is why some have suggested a sandbox approach to crypto wherein the network can take up to three years to decentralize both facets. \n\nHowever, decentralization can also be viewed as the component corresponding to the value of the token in a non-arbitrary way. Much like a process patent, one could imagine patenting the governance system which gives way to decentralization. It wouldn’t just be a happenstance process but an element of the network’s design. \n\nAs intellectual property the governance patent would benefit from all the existing international agreements making it a much more robust differentiator between networks."

Each right in this bundle of rights can be unpacked and be assigned to parties, be them at the individual, collective, municipal, national, regional or international level. The risk of dispute between various parties generally grows commensurate and proportional to the degree of complexities involved both vertically and horizontally. In governance the optimal design solution is to separate and allocate those bundle of rights at the onset in a harmonious manner to mitigate tensions, leaving any residual tension to be resolved through informal and formal channels of dispute resolution."

   "text": "Few initial reactions:\n- Blockchain may be agnostic but there is an argument to be said that the consensus protocol of Ethereum is “neoliberal” in the sense that it is highly dependent on market theory, while not asking if the particular market mechanisms used for validating transactions is optimally effective and efficient. Increased competition from alternative decentralized networks may ultimately answer that question…\n- Focus on antitrust/anticompetitive behavior open up the point on legally wrapped DAOs. Emerging legislation to offer DAOs may drive standards driven by antitrust principles if those DAOs wish to avail to legal protection and formal entity status. \n- The points on identity seem to suggest a philosophical pivot away from purely anonymous structures to a pseudonymous model with the added assurances that offers users. \n- Critique of Kleros’ ability to prevent collusion and offer rule of law based justice outcomes is a valid critique of financially incentivized Shelling Point justice models. Worth exploring further in Governauts to ideate on improved models for DAO mediation and dispute resolution adjudication. \n-  Casting 1Hive community and its social mission as a weakness is related to Governauts work on rewards systems and how a properly calibrated recognition system could use community to strengthen accountability in a large ecosystem with highly diverse user base."

I found this concept to be valuable and have used it ever since to negotiate all sorts of agreements. \n\nWe have a bias toward centralized economic systems because we believe the welfare that results from transactions isn’t increased in a way we deem to be equitable. Just recently a colleague insisted capitalism was governed by profit seeking which favors the capital owner. I retorted it was a choice. Every society decided for itself how the value created by a transaction, the welfare, is apportioned based on their subjective idea of fairness. More importantly, a society’s sense of legitimacy. \n\nWith decentralized economic systems the community participants get to decide for the themselves how welfare is legitimately apportioned regardless of the societal and cultural norms of the IRL community they inhabit. \n\nBlockchain governance maintains its community’s sense of welfare legitimacy."

    "I think almost everyone will agree data is the new oil, and big tech companies are the ones extracting a disproportionate amount of the value from the public’s data. You know the rest… auction model, modern day “slavery”, concentrated economic and political power, reality distortion,… The question we then have to ask is how do we use crypto to correct for this. \nMy uneducated answer is yes. \nPut crypto between the data and the users of that data to redistribute value extraction in more equitable manner. Instead of big tech extracting value using an auction system which maximizes their revenues and very little in general way of costs, we should be striving to have a system which benefits the individual data owner. Everyone becomes their own Exxon or BP. Everyone then has a UBI based off of their own data.\nSimilarly, today’s data users have seen upward pressure on auction prices which is contrary to their business models. \nAnd, regulators around the world are challenged to correct these misalignments.\nIs there a better way forward?\nIt is from this perspective that I have been thinking about the problem. Yesterday, I challenged ",

I think its a fair challenge to observe if a financial backed token for voting would incentivize sub-optimal behavior that doesn't support the group but instead benefits the individual.\n\nMy concern currently is that without an incentive to participate, you get low engagement on project proposals and voting. This doesn't have to be solved by financial incentives. It could be ego based. Example, Nouns projet (",

Thus, reputation can be good or bad [ill repute], rather than a high or a low value of a single metric.\n\nTying individual compensation to popular opinion [popularity contest] is generally frowned upon, due to being easily manipulated and readily diverging from the economic value of the contribution, based on whether it can be maintained indefinitely, in presence of market forces.\n\nHaving thought about this a while, I conclude generally that a single cumulative metric, however derived, cannot reflect separate aspects of the worth of someone's participation, particularly considered over time. Contribution of some mix of resources and effort is not interchangeable with strong engagement. Making unique expertise or specialized access available, is yet another component.\n\nFurther, conflating aggregated level of rewards with due influence in making decisions is also likely to lead to misalignment.\n\nThe fact that the influences cannot be reduced to a single cumulative metric does not indicate that the dynamic cannot be investigated analytically or studied quantitatively, but only that it is not trivial."

A whole range of DAO types, all the ones not tied directly to on-chain assets and crypto industry investment, not only have not flourished, but showed few signs of liveness.\n\nAll the cause-based, community-centric, regional, common interest, alternative living, agricultural or trade coop, research, art, or education, either folded immediately or only lasted through the initial round of funding or bubbling excitement of original founders.\n\nI call these \"soft\" DAOs, to borrow a term from commodity trading, and if such pursuits cannot be supported by DAO-like structures, then all the promises of DAOs changing the way humanity organizes and works are empty.\n\nI suspect that current belief system around DAOs glosses over crucial issues, and for systemic reasons, while some axiomatic principles are largely wishful thinking.  Would anyone be interested in methodic application of critical rational thinking here, heavily borrowing from more established fields, to  identify and classify open issues and challenges to growth and sustainability of DAO-like structures?\n\nI am collecting information and thoughts for an article \"How DAOs Fail\", but would prefer a more balanced and positive outlook, that takes the subject beyond a small batch of my personal experiences and opinions colored by emotion."

My hot take: DAOs could in a sense replace military as a concept re-utilizing supplies and technology for local and global relief work (it would be awfully nice to disrupt a pattern of genocide and colonialism), fund public goods and reshape the labor force. They could also solve the problem I'm sick of hearing Everytime I mention Abolition \"but what about all the bad guys\" therapy duh and we could have more specialized care for such medical and health reform initiatives. I think DAOs could also power education so that everyone can tailor it accordingly, choose your own adventure/ unlock your potential after the neurodiversity movement and the collapse of Academia (as a business) as we know it. I'm speaking a good deal into the future. I hope it's close though it feels like it."

   "text": "My concerns stem from now several observations of participant stratification in DAO-like structures, rather similar to what I have seen earlier in cause-based and advocacy non-profits.\n\nThere is a core group, where some are the original founders and their long-time buds. A number of them had served as a President or Vice or Treasurer over the years. Several may be variously compensated to be there, through the organization or as part of their employment or professional training elsewhere. Let's say there is a half dozen such, and about as many peripherally...\n\nThen, there is a flow of new arrivals, several / month, a minority of whom somehow associates with the core group and are still around 3-6 months ago, down to a small fraction after a year or two.\n\nIf the organization has a broad outreach program or hosts events and regular open meetings, the influx can be much larger, but at least in my experience the \"attachment\" rate does not increase much, not in any proportion to the volume of the visitors.\n\nThe \"core\" may have a somewhat different demographic than the \"visitors\", distributed perhaps toward an older and variously higher bracket of the socioeconomic and educational range. \"Us vs. then\" attitude strengthens, as the core is oversubscribed and readily exhausted, and becomes frustrated by getting no help nor appreciation.\n\nMeanwhile, the arrivals are confused or even taken aback by the established rituals in word and action, that may not even appear connected at this point. The few that make an attempt to connect and get involved may meet with indifference or even distrust, and are rarely supported through the process. The opinions and ideas that they voice may not even receive consideration and simply dissipate."

Prospects and customers might be a subsequent stage, but in better cases supporting building towards that.\n\nIf noobs are not caught and supported, on entry, that is why interest fades, and why folk don't reach the level of contributor.\n\nThe majority of learning curves need support. Not everyone is like developers, willing and able to learn for themselves. I understand GitHub is formed over 50% from people who taught themselves.\n\nImagine if schools worked liked that! Or even if they encouraged us to work like that!\n\nSo the test of any organisation, including DAOs, including corporates, is do they support their members in being autonomous, and in their personal growth journey. An organisation with growing teams will have a much better chance of growing itself. Conversely, if a group doesn't support personal growth, folk will leave to grow somewhere more conducive.\n\nA visiting prospective contributor cannot contribute unless proper connection is established.\n\nThe potential for contribution is established through the excellent open door policy. Not all DAOs see how to grasp that potential and make it material and rewarding.\n\nIt is good that many DAOs seek the in person connection through AMA sessions, but these have their limits, and are not all accessible.\n\nWhich leaves asynch, which can be a fruitful avenue for onboarding, but folk are less skilled in this area.\n\nThis is all learning curve territory. Switched on educators are a necessary component. Switched on corporates have hugely expensive corporate development systems, so expensive only Fortune 500 can typically afford them. Discord and some switched on DAOs could revolutionise that!"

In many cases I will bet they have not read or understood Steven Covey,  The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. Specifically, the win-win section. It's not everything, but it would be a great start. A more detailed and functional version of that is the Elinor Ostrom work , which can dovetail with other even more detailed work that is already out there.\n\nAll that probably speaks wonders for your powers of selection, and it would have been great to meet you when I was still involved with an EdTech startup."

We underestimate how difficult something is, and overestimate our chances of success.\n\nThere are also examples of how focusing on solutions against very ambitious goals lead to great outcomes, but statistics (early stage - 70% of products don't establish product-market-fit, mid stage - some high % don't make it past the first 2 years), say otherwise.\n\nI usually think of Jim Collins when I hear anyone talk about endearing companies, and he is probably one of the most knowledgeable people that comes up whenever I think of the subject (good to great, built to last).\n\nFocusing on the risk/weaknesses/threats is how they have survived imminent failure.\n\nSo, I would personally love to read this angle first.

   "text": "Fascinating perspective! You inspired me to attempt articulating the following thought experiment in a new context. Previously, I used school systems with groups of teachers and their specific leaders, a.k.a. principals. Above that level of representation, local schools belong to a certain district, which is one part of the whole state / country.\n\nThe hypothesis: relying on a single principal (or a single district-level organization) actually creates inefficiencies, now that we have more capacity for asynchronous coordination.\n\nTypically, decisions made in that context are budgetary. However, I’m curious whether a military context would help others understand the importance of pluralizations. Rather than using resource allocation as an example of the process to govern, maybe the idea of a war room could lend itself to this experiment:\n\nJust imagine a president has the big red button, and they are surrounded by generals with necessary info pertaining to that decision (whether to press it). The question is why do we trust our “Commander in Chief” instead of the whole room? My answer is urgency. Some types of decisions require utmost efficiency, so there is not enough time (or any limiting factor) to effectively coordinate pressing multiple buttons.\n\nThere is a similar problem with each general representing various branches of the military (navy, army, etc) and their specific departments. How can they possibly communicate all the pertinent info available?"

I've been interested in decentralization for about 20 years and really am a systems thinker. I do have a software company I'd like to convert to a dao because I believe it would be far better served as community driven. \n\nI also may have different perspctives on some of the issues mentioned but I really am here to learn as my ideas haven't been tested. My primary interests for governance are: \n\n1. distribution that is consolidation proof and attracts value added owners\n2. faciliitating engagement\n3. Governance that imitates a living being\n\nWhile there are a lot of variables in DAO governance, it seems that efficiency in these will have a multiplier effect on most others."

I see this as a funciton of four things: \n\n1. Proper distribution to prequalified owners (the idea being less of the right people is better than more of the wrong people)\n2. Proper onboarding and ongoing education of those owners into a culture of engagement\n3. Mechanisms that reward engagement proportionate to the quality of contribution\n4. Effective curation/ease of access to information required to make informed engagement.\n\nI think there may be a conditioned barrier to having engaged owner/voters which is apathy caused by the perception that their contribution doesn't impact their personal lives. This can be addressed with the above items. \n\nYou might be intersted to know that my software company is acutally a novel approach to rewards. I firmly believe that positive reinforcement is the most effective way to modify behavior and found that existing systems don't actually utilize the criteria needed for influincing behavior through rewards."

That led to restructuring rewards based on time to fit how costs are born by the business. It was a very difficult sale to service businesses because most service busiensses have low business acumen which is why I think it is much better community driven.

But as I've dug in, I realize just how new dao governance and support reallly is which has led me to looking for groups intersted in growing that aspect."

I think those that have been in this space for 3 years are *bleeding* edge. Cutting edge is great, bleeding edge hurts.\n\nWith that said, in behavioral modification, inspiration leads to motivation, motivation leads to action, and action leads to habit. If there is a breakdown in any of these or in transition, a modification fails. This is easy to say in abstraction, much more difficult to apply to the real world. \n\nI know I am very inspired by the potential that DAOs have to reshape society. I firmly believe they can push wealth back down and distribute consolidated power. I think there is a rising potential for this same hope to inspire others as they find themselves more and more disaffected by a system that can't meet their needs. We have some work to do to get that message out and then to transform that inspiration into motivation. That can get people in, but the action must be facilitated in a way that leads to the habit of engagement."

Many were great leaders but all of them took credit for the work of an entire organization. Everyone labored around making the commanders looks good and our whole careers were parades of establishing power and dominance over one another to ultimately climb to the top. Quite frankly when a decision is ever to be made or carried out I think 3 people present / representing a group should be a minimum. Not only good for accountability  but....so they cay support one another. \n\nMusings that crept through while driving for 6 hours."

    {

     "text": "https://trace.giveth.io/campaign/commons-stack-association"

    "), can be useful for donations and grants. Or shall we join a DAO project for funding, or make our own DAO?  Suggestions welcome! Our project UBI-Vault will move to Switzerland because half of the global money is stored there, and so it is easier to donate legally to the UBI-Vault. Switzerland is the only country worldwide where people can donate and do not have to tell where the money comes from, as long as they can tell where it will be used for. On a functionality level, a Company Island (which is a Citizen's Island plus products and services) can make use of simple DAO components, made available bij the Commons Stack. In our upcoming CI pilot with 2000 companies it would be really helpful to have such tools available. A first tool can be a simple direct democratie module, allowing people to make proposals and to vote."
