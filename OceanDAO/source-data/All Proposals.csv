Liquidity Pool Handling,Funded,2,Build & Integrate,General,"[x] [ ] Dissolve a liquidity pool and send back fair shares to the people that are in it by assessing the amount of tokens/liquidity pool shares that the participants own and then splitting up the Ocean in the pool accordingly and sending them to them. This will cost the dissolver ETH and possibly some of their own tokens.
This is impossible as dissolving a liquidity pool is impossible in the current configuration of the liquidity pools. The marketplace sets max tokens to minted tokens so minting more tokens is impossible. The assumption that was made for this is not possible - Trent also did not know about this as stated in the above YouTube video.
[x] [ ] Rebalance a liquidity pool by minting new tokens and sending them to the liquidity pool as well as the token holders. This will also cost the invoker ETH to do the transactions. But this could then be used by e.g. the Swash pool or old pools to fix their token : Ocean ratio.
Minting new tokens is impossible for pools created on the Ocean marketplace, therefore this cannot be done.

[x] [X] We are on track and aim to complete ALGAs Phase 2. However, we underestimated the challenges and budget requirements when starting our research & development to finalize this task.
1. We faced a delay when trying to find a solution to integrate OCEAN.js, WalletConnect or MetaMask to our existing App’s React Native Code. ALGAs current code-base is not compatible and there are major changes required.
2. After failing with our current developers, we aimed to solve this collaboratively by actively looking for support in the community, OCEAN developer channels and initiatives such as the Crowdcast Workshop (https://www.crowdcast.io/e/moonbuilders-ws/5).
3. To reach our goal, we have decided to hand over our code in August to a professional blockchain developer with vast experience in React Native. The proposed changes to our code, estimated timeline and technicals will be outlined in a detailed document that can be viewed below. The document is a work in progress and will be updated accordingly: https://bit.ly/3yPZQRc",Completed,,10000,0x5D2B315C465e133a346C960F46f5AA1ED88a3179,https://vote.oceanprotocol.com/#/officialoceandao.eth/proposal/QmVtJoo7hp3G5RXAVu9EjHT38Uknipqs7a78P7o8viLQtm,QmVtJoo7hp3G5RXAVu9EjHT38Uknipqs7a78P7o8viLQtm,16,,123725,0

RugPullIndex,Funded,2,Build & Integrate,General,"[x] [THIS IS ONGOING FOR RPI LIFETIME] Improve the rating algorithm’s resilience towards Sybil-resistance. We plan to replace the “OCEAN-staked” metric with an “OCEAN-days destroyed” metric. Details here.
[x] [x; ERIGON NODE] Increase the frequency of data pool retrievals (price, liquidity, etc.) daily, e.g., hourly.
- Update: We’ve been working towards this issue since a while now but we haven’t managed to prioritize it. It’d say now that we have the Erigon node and since we’ve separated the crawler into its own NPM package; we’re now closer than ever to implement this change. We can now make almost infinite API calls as we’re hosting our own node. And we’ve prepared the queries and the database to make a surgical change in an upcoming proposal. However, the budget in R2 has long been spent and so we’ll have to raise more to finish this.
[x] [x] Maintain and foster the website such that it stays performant and easy to use.
[x] [x] Document the inner workings of the algorithm publicly to improve transparency.
[x] [x] Work towards introducing an ERC20 token to allow direct investing in the index.
[x] [x] We plan to show the users a time-dependent graph of the index’s performance (our inspiration ). For that, we cleaned our database.
[x] [x] We improved the index by quoting EUR values (instead of OCEAN).
[x] [x] We improved the site’s SEO performance.
[x] [x] We improved the crawler’s stability.
[x] [x] We’ve evaluated the project’s thesis by analyzing the fall of ADASTA-60.

[x] [] A research project has not been started due to two main reasons. No research grant and free personnel has been available at the most interested research institutions so far and in addition to that the technology has not been perceived as mature enough / the market as not big enough.

As promised, with this round we bring to the Ocean community our first public-facing implementation of Zero-Knowledge Model usage on the Rinkeby network. We’ve published two assets:
-DistilGPT2 Model Parameters, for use in ZK-state using C2D [https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:aa82a24d62de1eB817c2173fff8B8c12d7b1Bbf9]

[https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:aa82a24d62de1eB817c2173fff8B8c12d7b1Bbf9]
[x] [*] 30th April : Partner with various AI companies for demo, onboard for launch, give advanced credits.
We exposed the public facing models for community testing for the first time. As AI models are non-deterministic, each inference request will result in 5 new, unique completions by the AI of a paragraph from wikipedia. We will be adding all the other algorithms as assets shortly for more complete testing.
Using these, users can get a feel for the power of Zero-Knowledge Model marketplaces on Ocean, without writing any code. One can perform inference and be certain that the same model asset was used to provide inference (verifiability), without being aware of the model parameters.

[x] [x] Hackathon Spree
OceanDAO has helped us take part in multiple hackathons over the summer and this has resulted in Opscientia being rewarded for our work and helping spotlight the importance of open science to the wider Web3 and scientific communities.
- The team took part in the ETHGlobal Web3Weekend hackathon to build a proof-of-concept of our Data Wallet. The next steps include building out the minimum viable product for scientists to use and test by the end of 2021.
- Our blog post outlining our experience at the ETHGlobal Web3Weekend hackathon - Opscientia DAO Wins Multiple Awards at the EthGlobal Hackathon
- The team also took part in the OHBM Brainhack 2021. Our GitHub issue explains our submission in greater detail
- We gathered user-research feedback from 5 scientists at the OHBM Brainhack. From this, we validated current pain points around academia and data. We gathered initial feedback on our Data Wallet proof-of-concept and sourced questions and comments to flesh out our FAQ’s.
[x] [x] Corporate partnerships with Neuroinformatics Consortia and to support the development of open-source toolkits for the neuroscience community
- Our partnership over the summer with Google’s GSoC was a success.
- We are continuing this work by drafting best practices for reproducible science and publishing the methods of how Web3 will help accelerate the improvement of those practices. This is an ongoing process and will help us develop functional, and user-first tools for scientists.
[x] [x] Survey and quantitative metrics regarding attitudes toward the Data Economy, Ocean Academy, and Web 3.0
- Further to the OHBM hackathon we carried out user-research in the community and have gathered 12 responses which have validated pain points, levels of understanding, and feedback on our vision. This further helped us to generate our FAQ’s and generate high-level user-requirements for the Opsciverse.
[x] [x] Providing initial liquidity to publish the first neuroimaging dataset pool and applications for compute-to-data
- This work is ongoing and initial steps have been taken to publish BIDS Apps and Shady’s brain  on the gaia-x testnet.
[x] [x] Content creation
- We have launched our blog page, please check it out to see what we are up to.
- Walkthrough tutorials have been published on git-annex, DataLad and IPFS:

There are major trade-offs involved in running our own Custom hardware based Ocean Market and posting assets on Ocean Market - which we’ve detailed in this document - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PBvxKD3_a0DsSjfjCrqOWJXew6idl4f9Py3dKrPRxTs/edit?usp=sharing. This includes a summary of our extensive work towards setting up our own K8 +C2D environment as well.
Due to these trade-offs, we decided to prioritize API access to our models on Ocean Market First, before working on the much longer process of setting up our own marketplace.
Briefly, publishing Models on Ocean Market can be done (upto model sizes of 128M params) and is itself a $100 million + market. Meanwhile the development and server costs of hosting our own market are enormous. Therefore we’ve prioritised delivering working AI models on Ocean Market first, before working on the longer term and larger goal of Making our own fork of Ocean Market, which will probably require 3+ months more and some additional funding besides Ocean DAO.",Completed,,7500,0x21e06646433954aabace8e3d93d502e423249299,https://vote.oceanprotocol.com/#/officialoceandao.eth/proposal/QmfSLNdwGy2Gd9X6W5QRHtTft2Xigs1YsXMGxTvGFNsEna,QmfSLNdwGy2Gd9X6W5QRHtTft2Xigs1YsXMGxTvGFNsEna,,,667711,500

VideoWiki,Funded,6,Build & Integrate,General,"Round 6: Researched various streaming options to onboard to our marketplace. Build UI around the Casting flow and conducted successful pilot events.
[x] Status - Completed. Private Beta live at CAST.Video.Wiki
This was by far our most challenging and most rewarding work. We changed our course of action but explored options to get the CAST live to get validations and prove the working with 2 events (and more in pipeline). We partnered with multiple entities to get this going and staked all our brands on one technology solution. We almost bet it all on just one thing working fine in the end.
Instead of building a decentralized ticket system, we explored and worked on the complete cast solution which was an over commitment that took us 3 months to finish. The first ever live cast on the system was with OCEAN projects DataUnion, DataWhale and Algovera (Previously Onshore) with a series of 4 showcase sessions, one 8 hour conference, and then another 16 hour (2 day) event running on the system, without a glitch.",Completed,18000,18000,0xe151E8BE121864EDDB83E7D0484b87596cAD2fA5,https://vote.oceanprotocol.com/#/officialoceandao.eth/proposal/Qmca7fw5EmZD4BC9YCLD1tqTzUEPCo8qxsY39c6ZVSesHZ,Qmca7fw5EmZD4BC9YCLD1tqTzUEPCo8qxsY39c6ZVSesHZ,,,451656,0

Posthuman AI,Funded,6,Build & Integrate,General,"Since the last DAO round, we’ve made major upgrades to our codebase, focusing on developing commercially useful variants of the models (DistilBERT and DistilGPT2) and algorithims that we shared earlier (with v1)- to accure value for Ocean holders and to enable corporate AI use-cases directly from Ocean Market.
[x] [*] Developing Posthuman Market deployment for allowing a larger variety of models
With Posthuman v1.2 we’ve developed and introduced an entirely new library of algorithms, under the title “QA-Commercial”. This is meant to interact with proprietary AI models (developed by Posthuman, LUCI, or other parties), to enable AI question-answering on 1000s of corporate documentation in a matter of seconds. Some of the key features of QA-Commercial:
1. Integrates with DrQA library for ngram and TF-IDF shortlisting of paragraphs, which are then fed into the pipeline with a custom trained DistilBERT model for question answering on 1000s or even millions of pages of documents (instead of just 1 para, as enabled by Posthuman v1 models).
2. Provides enterprise grade server capabilities for continuous question answering for upto 24 hours at a time. This includes not just a django server, but celery + redis worker allocation for load balancing, enabling rapid, parallel processing of multiple queries at the same time without any errors.
In addition to QA-Commercial algorithms, we’ve also developed the following:
1. DistilBERT is trained for question answering only on Wikipedia. We’ve produced two models by fine-tuning this model on:
[x] [*] Engaging with AI partners LUCI to bring their enterprise AI to posthuman-
A. Proprietary corporate data, including commercial, email, and customer service documentation, for a commercially valuable version of the model (LUCI). This combined with QA-Commercial Algos enables largescale question-answering on Corporate Documentation with never seen before accuracy.
B. US Legal data - this allows models to read US law (including federal and state statutes, and judgements) to answer specific questions about the law.
[We will not be sharing the model parameters here; instead we will directly post them on Ocean Market(Polygon) once the bugs mentioned in the progress report are resolved - allowing this model to potentially accure 100s of $k in value]
[x] [*] Engaging AI companies by offering them a monetization oppourtunity; Onboarding next ~5 corporate customers. -
4. We plan on initiating discussions with PacerPro , Datanomy and DeepC , to hopefully onboard them as users and/or providers of AI models on Posthuman Market.

[x] [x] Hackathon Spree
OceanDAO has helped us take part in multiple hackathons over the summer and this has resulted in Opscientia being rewarded for our work and helping spotlight the importance of open science to the wider Web3 and scientific communities.
- The team took part in the ETHGlobal Web3Weekend hackathon to build a proof-of-concept of our Data Wallet. The next steps include building out the minimum viable product for scientists to use and test by the end of 2021.
- Our blog post outlining our experience at the ETHGlobal Web3Weekend hackathon - Opscientia DAO Wins Multiple Awards at the EthGlobal Hackathon
- The team also took part in the OHBM Brainhack 2021. Our GitHub issue explains our submission in greater detail
- We gathered user-research feedback from 5 scientists at the OHBM Brainhack. From this, we validated current pain points around academia and data. We gathered initial feedback on our Data Wallet proof-of-concept and sourced questions and comments to flesh out our FAQ’s.
[x] [x] Corporate partnerships with Neuroinformatics Consortia and to support the development of open-source toolkits for the neuroscience community
- Our partnership over the summer with Google’s GSoC was a success.
- We are continuing this work by drafting best practices for reproducible science and publishing the methods of how Web3 will help accelerate the improvement of those practices. This is an ongoing process and will help us develop functional, and user-first tools for scientists.
[x] [x] Survey and quantitative metrics regarding attitudes toward the Data Economy, Ocean Academy, and Web 3.0
- Further to the OHBM hackathon we carried out user-research in the community and have gathered 12 responses which have validated pain points, levels of understanding, and feedback on our vision. This further helped us to generate our FAQ’s and generate high-level user-requirements for the Opsciverse.
[x] [x] Providing initial liquidity to publish the first neuroimaging dataset pool and applications for compute-to-data
- This work is ongoing and initial steps have been taken to publish BIDS Apps and Shady’s brain  on the gaia-x testnet.

[x] [X] We faced delays and challenges in finding a suitable Blockchain development team with adequate React Native experience since our R7 proposal in July. Therefore, we decided to develop additional functionalities for ALGA. meanwhile. These functionalities were not presented in any of our past proposals and the development cost has been covered by partial funds received in R7. Therefore, our initial deliverable of creating a fully integrated Web3 dApp with Data Token wallet and trading functionality may require additional funding and the process will be recorded here: https://bit.ly/3yPZQRc. The below functions have been developed.
- Backup Here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jef-tqYpAXc
- Download Test-Version on Android here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/198HCoz8D_JSfgwuUOru22XoSDxwxFGxC/view?usp=sharing
1. Improvement of Signup & Profile Creation, via Mobile Authentication (Twilio)
2. Improved backend data gathering.
3. Implemented “My Watchlist” Section on the Home Screen
4. Removed fixed price assets from ALGAs data gathering and INDEX tab, focused on Data Token Pools to ramp up for trading functionality in Phase 2.
5. General improvements on visualization (Spelling, Decimal Points etc.)
[x] [X] In addition to the functionalities highlighted in this proposal, we have also directed funds to re-design the entire UI/UIX of ALGA, with the vision of creating a world-class mobile dApp for Data Tokens. This activity was not proposed in previous rounds. We hope you like the design and appreciate your feedback! We have also designed a dark-mode as outlined before

RAZ Finance,Funded,8,Unleash Data,New Entrants,"Update 1:

[x] Grant Deliverable 1
*** Impact, ESG and sustainability datasets traded on the Ocean Market**
Progress update:
Our first early adopter projects: Roshem Impact, a Certified B Corporation, and two companies working towards B Corp certification: Maven Hemp and Shah Hemp, have consented to making their data available on the Ocean Market. We expect our first datasets to be published in September 2021, earlier than originally planned for March 2022 and in alignment with the 90-day project timeline. For datatokens will be associated to product data, Maven Hemp is participating in the groundbreaking Radicle ACES trial for CBD products https://radiclescience.com/resources/radicle-science-spotlight-maven-hemp and product data will include publishable results from the scientific study.
The Ocean Protocol logo, introductory details and information about the grant have been added to the RAZ Finance Information Deck: https://razfinance.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RAZ-Finance-Information-Deck-v05-August-2021-COMPLETE-2-1.pdf

@AlexN and @kaimeinke we are awaiting feedback from the DAO to onboard companies and achieve the following: Cross-promotion of Ocean DAO members actively measuring and managing their impact, sustainability and ESG data.


[x] Grant Deliverable 2
RAZ Network membership revenue generated via OCEAN
The ability to make network membership, impact measurement and management, as well as platform customization and licensing payments via OCEAN was integrated on September 1st 2021

[x] Grant Deliverable 3
Integrated Impact-Financial Datasets Traded on the Ocean Market
Progress Update: Our goal is to trade data from 3-5 investment funds and 8-10 mission driven companies.
Between August 9th and August 31st, we onboarded the following:
Investment Funds: Syzygy Impact and GreenTech
Mission-Driven Companies: Maven Hemp, Shah Hemp, Ramprate, CMore
Therefore, we are almost halfway to our target and are aiming to onboard 1-3 more investment funds, and 4-6 more mission-driven companies within the next 60 days as part of our project goals.


/------/

Update 2:

[x] Grant Deliverable 1
*** Impact, ESG and sustainability datasets traded on the Ocean Market**
We will be making data available from our first early adopter projects, including those with Roshem Impact, a Certified B Corporation, and two companies working towards B Corp certification: Maven Hemp and Shah Hemp, available on the Ocean Market.
Update: Data will be verified through “proof of existence” and digital signatures stored on the Cardano blockchain to facilitate traceability, security, and make it possible for progress to be tracked through a public ledger. Additional data will be sourced from companies, organizations and initiatives that utilize the RAZ platform to apply for calls for proposals published by the RAZ DAO community. Our progess will increase engagement and make the “impact in action” dataset more robust and reliable.
RAZ Finance is a Crypto AM Awards nominee in the Environment, Social and Governance category 1. The support of the Ocean DAO community in relation to our project has been published on all RAZ social media channels: LinkedIn, Twitter and Instagram.
[x] Grant Deliverable 2
- RAZ Network membership revenue generated via OCEAN
The RAZ Network https://raznetwork.net and individual data management platforms https://razfinance.io will be made available to members, asset managers and companies via OCEAN currency. We expect that approximately 30% of our expected platform revenue can take place via OCEAN. As such, revenue from the project itself will generate 0.2% return to the Ocean DAO ecosystem.
Update: Our main platform will be accessible to any $RAZ token holder. Customized platforms for individual companies and initiatives will be a paid feature as part of due diligence and impact-financial data verification processes. As such, our revenue stream has expanded from the initial membership-based model, to a feature-driven model that will make it possible for a larger number of companies, as well as nonprofits, to access RAZ.
[x] Grant Deliverable 3
- Integrated Impact-Financial Datasets Traded on the Ocean Market
Data collected from early adopters: 3-5 impact investment funds and 8-10 mission-driven companies Verified impact and financial datasets linked to Ocean ERC20 datatokens
Update: Our initial model was based on the engagement of a small group of initial early adopters. We have since transitioned to an open platform model that makes it possible for our DAO community to access RAZ, while paid features are customized for business and nonprofit use cases. Our DAO community is launching “calls for proposals” in specific impact areas, including “Regenerative Innovation: Wellness, Agriculture and Production” as well as “Ocean Impact”. Our DAO will be voting on which projects to fund as a result of these calls. Companies will be utilizing RAZ to provide data on their impact and financial performance to qualify for funding and list their opportunities on our platform. As such, we will be casting a wider net that will allow us to collect data faster and more efficiently. Revenue from the trading of data as part of our Ocean Market datapools will go back to the RAZ DAO treasury to be deployed to winning proposals, therefore this creates more incentivization for companies to participate and provide data. This process overcomes an early-stage challenge we experienced related to how to incentivize companies to consent to their data being traded as part of an Ocean Market pool.

In this regard, we have added the following new sources of text and articles: Ocean Blog, Coin Telegraph to complement the existing sets of news information from Crypto daily, crypto slate and coindesk. These will be ongoing new sources of text data that we are continuing to grow our dataset with and provide feature libraries.
[x] We will publish a new dataset to provide the extracted Semantic features, such as bag-of-words, matrix factorization - deep learning-based word embeddings, as shown in Stage 2 the Value-Add Pipeline (VAP)
In this regard, we have written the python code to produce more advanced feature sets and we have scoped the JSON data format we will utilise to present these to the market. So far we have been creating spectral features and matrix factorisations for Document-Word matrics and Document-Document, and Word-Word matrices. These will be uploaded in our JSON market files as they are processed.
[x] Maintenance and data support for data buyers.
The data is continuing to be updated on a weekly rolling basis. Furthermore, we have created a python application that will be hosted and run from streamlit that will allow users to interact with the summary features of our data library and feature libraries. This will show case a detailed analytics dashboard to provide clarity to the market on exactly the size of our data and feature library, the content by topic, by token and by new source. We will continue to maintain and update this new hosted analytics tool to also provide sentiment and other analytics to do with authors and news source decompositions.
[x] Submit academic research paper to journal
We have submited a journal paper to a leading computational econometrics journal i which we study using our data set and a new class of time-series and Deep learning models the relationship between price, technology factors such as hash rate and sentiment constructed from our market place data. This journal is currently in peer review and once accepted we will be able to also release the preprint version to the community along with github repository for the code which we will enhance and turn into a compute-to-data module in future once peer reivew is complete.

Explanations of what these metrics are and why they are important will be created and shared on the RPI blog to attract new RPI users and make RPI a more valuable resource for existing users.
I’ll mark these tasks as done though I guess we could have done more targeted work to solve it. All throughout August and September Scott and I had repeated conversations on which direction we want to take the company towards. As we both concluded: We first needed to figure out what we’re actually doing before we commit to any metrics. So here’s what we’ve done until now:
- We’ve identified shared goals that we have with the project
- We have further investigated offline how I can incorporate a company; We still have a lot of unknowns and doubts though so it could take more time.
- We have done some initial work to understand what it takes from a technical perspective to measure our metrics.
- We’ve spent some time elaborating on all personas that interact with rugpullindex and what their motivations are; We now have a good overview of who we want to serve.
- I’ve written a couple of blog posts that also address some questions we’ve asked ourselves in the process:
    - Is Competition For Losers?
    - We’re not a startup
    - On Building The Infamous “Version 2”
Finally; We now have developed first drafts for what we think is an exciting vision and mission for the rug pull index. We have internal documents that do a good job outlining what it is, but to publicize it; I think it’d be advisable for us to re-iterate.

Impact in Action: Practical impact measurement and management, stakeholder engagement, ESG and sustainability datasets traded on the Ocean Market
The STRORC-30 dataset features expanded data related to practical “Impact in Action” as influenced by stakeholders across both developed and emerging markets, beyond established frameworks and reporting models. The dataset will therefore be able to influence research and development related to impact metrics, ESG assessment frameworks, and regulations such as the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). The increasing scope of the data collected therefore makes STRORC-30 of interest to a wider range of decision-makers, sustainability, impact and ESG practitioners, as well as asset managers.
RAZ Finance is a Crypto AM Awards nominee in the Environment, Social and Governance category. The support of the Ocean DAO community in relation to our project has been published on all RAZ social media channels: LinkedIn, Twitter and Instagram.

Impact Finance Evolved: Integrated Financial, Environmental, Social and Governance Datasets Traded on the Ocean Market by January 1st 2022
Update: Our initial model was based on the engagement of a small group of initial early adopters. We have since transitioned to an open platform model that makes it possible for our DAO community to access RAZ, while paid features are customized for business and nonprofit use cases. Our DAO community is launching “calls for proposals” in specific impact areas, including “Regenerative Innovation - Wellness, Agriculture and Production” as well as “Ocean Impact”. Our DAO will be voting on which projects to fund as a result of these calls. Companies will be utilizing RAZ to provide data on their impact and financial performance to qualify for funding and list their opportunities on our platform. As such, we will be casting a wider net that will allow us to collect data faster and more efficiently. Revenue from the trading of data as part of our Ocean Market datapools will go back to the RAZ DAO treasury to be deployed to winning proposals, therefore this creates more incentivization for companies to participate and provide data.

◦ historical and current high-level extracted sentence structure features
◦ spectral and matrix factorisation features obtained from the document-document and word-word matrices, as a separate dataset
In this regard, we have released two additional datasets.
The first contains the noise-free, processed article sentences for all current news sources and assets for the complete period that the Real News Crypto dataset covers (2017-present). This dataset will be maintained and extended in the following weeks to include higher-level structural features (grammar trees and syntax graphs) of the provided sentences. The dataset is now available at a fixed price at: https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:a62962De45BEE6C99cae7a685D4f8ee1EaB7825C
The second dataset contains the top-3 tokens’ and articles’ spectral components (eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the word-word and document-document matrices) for the weekly article collections in the spanned period. Note that the dictionary tokens belong to a custom cryptocurrency-specific vocabulary, which has been sentiment-annotated hence it is expressive of market sentiment for the covered period. This is particularly informative for market participants wanting to gain insights into the market dynamics from an investors’ sentiment perspective. The dataset is now available at a fixed price at:
https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:E0AB818DB99dd89548512407A328A9D7Bf6f994a

[x] Extra delivered: 
General knowledge base on SSI wallets, federated learning & Privacy-preserving AI. While doing the research, we realised that obtaining background information on different types of federate learning models and privacy-preserving AI models is necessary for readers to understand our research. Naturally, we included this in our documentation.
 GitHub



[x] Deliverable 1: 
Create an architecture on how the Compute-To-Data technology could be applied on SSI wallets.
Currently Ocean’s compute-to-data uses an architecture that involves kubernetes clusters where a visiting docker container contains the machine learning algorithm and kubernetes configurations allowing it access to (portions) of the data. A new method has to be devised for SSI Wallets as they are typically running on mobile phones which do not allow for apps to run kubernetes server clusters in a usable fashion.
 GitHub


[x] Deliverable 2: 
Create a knowledge base with the precise definition of Compute-To-SSI, it’s purpose, architecture (including diagrams) and the way to create software using it. This will be set up as a public git repository and will track further progress of the project as well as allow anyone to participate/contribute.
 GitHub


[x] Deliverable 3: 
Model how SSI wallets would interact with the Ocean Protocol ecosystem, i.e. rent existing machine learning models, how to pay for it, or be paid for it. This will naturally be added to the knowledge base.
This deliverable is mostly woven into the rest of the text. Most details can be found in the 2 subparts mentioned, but in order to acquire all information on this deliverable, one must read the entire document.

Coral Market,Funded,9,Build & Integrate,,"Team Opsci is happy to report that we have met all of our Round 9 deliverables and that work continues on our roadmap for Coral, our Open Science Marketplace dApp.
[x] [x] Research data object self-descriptions and mapping to Ocean Protocol Data Token Metadata
The Research Object Self Descriptions technical document has outlined basic specifications for a research data object on Ocean with emphases on self description fields that promote interoperability for parent Research Project Objects and their children (Datasets, Experiments, & Notebooks). Next steps include additional research and development, test data token deployments, and interviews with computational scientists to properly assess workflow branch points and requirements.
[x] [x] Architectural specification, diagram, and technical documentation for Coral Market Application Layer
The summary of work completed on Coral, the Scientific Data Marketplace, can be found on Opscientia Documentation: Coral Market. We have successfully forked a rebranded marketplace and have published a preliminary architecture for hosting and serving large datasets. Next steps involve updating the front-end with a landing page for scientist-friendly documentation, investigating custom back-end architecture for running our own PoA test network, and support for data storage and computation.
[x] [x] Develop best practices for engineers to onboard onto Web3 Big Data projects
Onboarding Documentation for Engineers has been created to help us onboard developers for the next stage of research and development. We expect to bring on contractors for devOps work and data engineering.
[x] [x] Publish science-friendly onboarding documentation onto Web3 marketplaces
We have published our community documentation at docs.opsci.io. Next steps include integrating user research and commissioning a front-end designer to build easy to understand onboarding materials for the Coral landing page.
[x] [x] User Research + User Requirement Design Feedback from Scientists
We have made our User Survey for Decentralised Research Data Storage & Management results open source for the community. Next steps involve releasing the materials and instrumentation on https://github.com/opscientia/desci/community/surveys and obtaining additional feedback on our first market prototype once it is published and functioning on test net.
[x] [x] Technical research reports on the integration of Filecoin Storage Auctions with Open Science Data aggregators to provide low-cost storage options for decentralized laboratories
We have made our research report on Open Neuroscience Data Archival and Retrieval on Filecoin open source. Next steps are to develop tooling to streamline painpoints for pre-processing and preparing data for submission to Filecoin. We are also actively exploring methods for submitting auctions as part of the Ocean.js workflow now that Textile has integrated a Filecoin bridge to Ethereum.
[x] [x] Rebranded Ocean Market fork on Ethereum / Polygon testnet
We have deployed a rebranded Ocean Market fork that can be found here https://market-opsci.netlify.app/ 1. We require additional architecture and back-end research to deploy a network on a test net with example scientific assets such as: datasets, computation, experiments, and notebooks.",Completed,22764,22764,0x33359285f30e7b3386de70ca500f4fe27853765b,https://snapshot.org/#/officialoceandao.eth/proposal/QmbQHFknNhRD9P3HN6HuR4QeuiR9oKdanzsLufo7otK6v8,QmbQHFknNhRD9P3HN6HuR4QeuiR9oKdanzsLufo7otK6v8,,,1244574,34
